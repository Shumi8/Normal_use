git remote add origin -> means the url in which we will host our repository -> url shortname origin
git remote -v -> tells url, where to fetch and push
git push origin master -> repo not found cuz repository is private so we have to take r/w access through SSH keys
****Theory****
1- key generate
2- than we get Agent process ID
3- add SSH private key to the agent ->ssh add..
4- cat command ->shows content
5- copy cat output and add in ssh keys
6- git remote set-url origin....switch to SSH and change url 
****end****


git push origin master -> files in browser
git checkout login 
git push -u origin login -> now 2 branches
